As an authorized Microsoft partner, Microsoft Office 365 offers you an opportunity to grow your customer base and create lasting relationships with them. For a monthly or annual fee paid to you, your customers can use cloud-based services so they don't have to manage data backups, server hardware, and server updates. The services available to you depend on the types of services you are authorized to provide.
  
> [!NOTE]
> For more information on how to use partner features, see [Build your business and administer your Office 365 partner subscription](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=271614&amp;clcid=0x409) and review the partner features presentation. To receive access to the partner features, you can join Cloud Essentials by signing the [Microsoft Online Services Partner Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=285473). 
  
## <a name="create-trial-invitations-and-purchase-orders"></a>创建试用邀请和采购订单

You can create and send trial invitations to your customers so they can try Office 365 by using the **Partner overview** page in Office 365. The invitation can contain one or more services, depending on the offer. If you're certified to offer delegated administration, you can add an option to the trial invitation that allows you to administer the account on behalf of your customer. This makes it easier for your customer to try Office 365. 
  
After you've sent a trial invitation for Office 365 to a customer, you can follow up by creating and sending a purchase offer that's customized to fit the needs of your customer including the specific services and the number of licenses your customer needs. If you're certified to offer delegated administration, you can add the option to the purchase offer that allows you to administer the account on behalf of your customer.
  
## <a name="provide-delegated-administration"></a>提供委派管理

Delegated administration allows a partner to have full administrative access to all the customer's services and subscriptions. This means you can perform administrative tasks on behalf of customers (including setting up mailboxes, adding or removing users and groups, data migration, and submitting service requests to Microsoft Customer Service and Support). Delegated administration capability is offered exclusively for partners who are enrolled in Cloud Essentials, Cloud Accelerate or the Cloud Deployment programs.
  
Before you can start administering a customer's account, the customer must authorize you as a delegated administrator. To get customer approval, you send them an offer for delegated administration, which you can include with a trial invitation or purchase offer. The customer authorizes a Delegated Administration partner by responding to the partner's invitational email.
  
每个客户有权拥有一个委派管理合作伙伴。 此合作伙伴也可以是客户的记录合作伙伴 (POR)，但不需要一定是记录合作伙伴。 POR 和委派管理合作伙伴的角色是相互独立的，客户可以分别指定它们。 这样可允许客户为采购建议选择一个合作伙伴，为实施或受管服务选择另一个合作伙伴。 还允许合作伙伴选择是否与其中一个或两个角色的专业人员建立业务关系。
  
即使客户授权合作伙伴代表自己执行管理任务，客户也仍可以直接与 Microsoft 技术支持联系，并提交服务请求。
